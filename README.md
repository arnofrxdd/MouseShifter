## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Why do I need VJoy?**  
A: Most games do not natively recognize mouse movements as H-shifter inputs. VJoy acts as a **virtual joystick**, allowing your mouse or controller inputs to be mapped as proper gear shifts in the game. Without it, the overlay cannot communicate with the game as a joystick device.  

**Q: Why isn‚Äôt my MouseShifter knob moving while in-game?**  
A: **run MouseShifter as administrator**.

## üìù Notes

- Controller support is experimental; XInput works natively, PS controllers require DS4Windows.  
- Built-in VJoy ensures smooth compatibility with games that support virtual joysticks.
