## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Why do I need vJoy?**  
A: Most games do not natively recognize mouse movements or keys as H-shifter inputs. vJoy acts as a **virtual joystick**, allowing your mouse or controller inputs to be mapped as proper gear shifts in the game.

**Q: Why isn‚Äôt my MouseShifter knob moving while in-game?**  
A: **Run MouseShifter as administrator.**
